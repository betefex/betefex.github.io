# BeTefex Perfect Matching technology
![Architecture overview](architecture.svg)
The BeTefex Perfect Matching technology is driven by advances in logic solvers (SMT using CDCL) combined with GPU acceleration. A whitepaper giving a further overview of what a "perfect" market is, and describing the logics side of how the BeTefex Perfect Matching technology achieves it, is available [here.](betefex_whitepaper.pdf)
